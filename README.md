## ✨ Features / What’s Included
- Java implementations of **common data structures**: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- Solutions to **classic algorithms**: sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.
- Organized packages for different problem categories.
- Simple, beginner-friendly **main classes** to run each problem directly.
- Ready-to-use **examples** for quick testing and practice.

## 💡 Tips for Learners

1. Start with arrays and strings, then move on to linked lists, stacks, and queues.
2. Practice sorting and searching algorithms to build strong foundations.
3. Gradually move to trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.
4. Try to solve problems first on paper before coding.
5. Use this repository to run, modify, and learn from the examples.

Now it’s **one markdown document** with all sections formatted correctly.  

Do you also want me to add a **"Contributing" and "License" section** at the end so your repo looks professional like open-source projects?
