## ✨ Features / What’s Included
- Java implementations of **common data structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.).
- Solutions to **classic algorithms** (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.).
- Organized packages for different problem categories.
- Simple, beginner-friendly **main classes** to run each problem directly.
- Ready-to-use **examples** for quick testing and practice.

## Tips for Learners
💡 Tips for Learners

1.Start with arrays and strings, then move on to linked lists, stacks, and queues.

2.Practice sorting and searching algorithms to build strong foundations.

3.Gradually move to trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

4.Try to solve problems first by hand before coding.

5.Use this repository to run, modify, and learn from the examples.
